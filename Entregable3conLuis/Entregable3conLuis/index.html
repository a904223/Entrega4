    <a href="PedirTrabajadores.html">Trabajadores</a>

    <p> AUTHOR: Aitor Aguirrebeña Ollo </p>
    <p>SHORT DESCRIPTION:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    This function will allow the user to check each employee's work shifts and also to add off days if required.

    </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Introduce the following date to test it: <b>08/03/2017 </b>
    <p>EXPLANATION: When the user accesses the PedirTrabajadores.html form, it will be required to introduce a date. Once this is done, the servlet will get those values and print an interactive work shift table, by clicking 
       the submit button and will print a calendar with the employees' working shifts, by getting them from the database. Only a week will be printed, so that all the shifts can fit. There is a draggable button to set a day or days off, which by dropping it on a certain day it automatically updates the work shift.
       Drag and drop the Day Off to change the Database information, sending a request to the servlet Save_Shifts, via AJAX and getting the response.
    </p>
    This whole functionality includes two functions:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Trabajadores:</b> it prints the shifts and the calendar.</li>
        <li><b>Save_Shifts:</b> once the "Day Off" drop off is done, it inserts in the database the selected day, and it sets it off for the chosen employee.</li>

    <li>
    This function will show a table with all the information about the employees, stored in the Database. It also allows the user to change the information, and save it back in the DB.

    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>EXPLANATION: When the user clicks on the menu Accounting/Staff/Employees the ShowInfoEmployees function, the information in the DB will be displayed in a table. There is a button, to modify the information, which displays inpunts in order to modify the actual information. Once this is done, the Save button will save the modified data to the DB, sending it to the servlet Save_InfoEmployees via AJAX.
    </p>
    This whole functionality includes two functions:
    <ul>
        <li><b>ShowInfoEmployees:</b> it prints the data in the table.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>
    This function will allow the user to change the password.

    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>EXPLANATION: The html called PasswordChange.html shows a form with the username, actual password and new password fields. The user will be required to fill its username first. Then, the actual password will be required, the one used before changing. Lastly, the new password will be requested. I have added some JAVASCRIPT code, to check both new passwords are the same, and to check that the new passwords contain a UPPERCASE LETTER, LOWERCASE LETTER, and ath least some numbers.
    Last but not least, if all the requirements are fullfilled, it updates the old password with the new one in the DB.
